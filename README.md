# Computational-Economics
Beginner-level computational economics with Python

An autodidactic project drawing mainly from Sargent & Stachurski's textbook <a href="http://quant-econ.net/"><i>Quantitative Economics</i></a>.

Short-term goals: write programs in Python for 2Ã—2 games, linear regressions, and DSGE models
<br>Medium-term goals: explore agent-based models & machine learning; replicate academic papers
<br>Long-term goals: learn C++, explore applications in quantitative finance, write applied research papers
