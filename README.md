# Computational Economics

<b>Computational Economics</b> ← numerical methods (Judd), curse of dimensionality, Turing machines, Gödel’s theorem
<br><b>Machine Learning & Econometrics</b> ← structural vs. reduced-form, tour of algorithms, game theoretic classifiers
<br><b>Recursive Macroeconomics</b> ← tutorial on Kalman filters; DSGE models; dynamic programming, Bellman equation
<br><b>Algorithmic Game Theory</b> ← complexity, new solution concepts, regret minimization, learning in games, networks
<br><b>Automated Mechanism Design</b> ← incentive-compatible mechanisms, combinatorial auctions, human computation
<br><b>Computational Social Choice</b> ← Gibbard-Satterthwaite, preference aggregation, resource allocation, social software
<br><b>Artificial Economics</b> ← Cellular automata, Schelling’s segregation model, agent-based modelling, genetic algorithms
<br><b>Mechanized Proof</b> ← ForMaRE project, Curry-Howard isomorphism, homotopy type theory, abstract interpretation
<br><b>Cryptoeconomics</b> ← rational cryptography, cryptographic solution concepts, differential privacy, Blockchain/bitcoin
<br><b>Digital Economics</b> ← options & modularity, distributed computing, logic games (e.g. Büchi automata), game semantics

<b>Computational economics with Python, R, and Haskell</b>

Short-term goals include writing programs for solving 2×2 games and computing linear regressions.
<br>Other basic projects include cooperative solution concepts, combinatorial games, and linear programming.

Medium-term goals include experimenting with agent-based models and machine learning.
<br>Another goal is to replicate published papers and experiment with theorem provers (e.g. Agda).

A long-term goal is to ‘translate’ Sargent & Stachurski's <a href="http://quant-econ.net/"><i>Quantitative Economics</i></a> from Python to Haskell.
<br>I'd also like to work on integrating avant-garde tools from CS such as formal verification into economics
